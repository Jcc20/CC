# Transport Layer Protocols

In this project, we had to study several transport layer protocols by analyzing network traffic in **Wireshark** and in topologies built in the **xubuncore** virtual machine
provided by the teachers, in order to answer the questions proposed correctly.

This assignment was developed in **Communications by Computer**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
