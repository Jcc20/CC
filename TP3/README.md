# Names Resolution Service (DNS)

The purpose of this project was to witness first-hand how the DNS works, by testing it in a UNIX environment in an initial phase, and later installing and configurating our own DNS server in a **xubuncore** topology.

This assignment was developed in **Communications by Computer**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
