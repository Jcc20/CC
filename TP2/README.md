# Originator's Anonimity Overlay Network

In this project, the objective was to develop a gateway network to abstract the connection to a target server, so as to prevent package sniffing that might reveal the sender's identity. This implied the creation of a new **PDU**, as well as the use of **TCP** and **UDP** sockets.

This assignment was developed in **Communications by Computer**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
